Simple object to wrap three [NSFileHandle](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSFileHandle_Class/index.html): 'output', 'error' to write and 'input' to read

There is of course a default instance for [standard streams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams)
```swift
let csl = Phiole.std
```

This object could be used in script or CLI application instead of using `println()`.
This adds the following abilities : 
* Write to a file by declaring transparently an [NSFileHandle](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSFileHandle_Class/index.html) as output stream
* Write to error stream
* Read from input stream

[Swift scripts: How to write small command line scripts in Swift](http://practicalswift.com/2014/06/07/swift-scripts-how-to-write-small-command-line-scripts-in-swift/)

:warning: Phiole is not a login system. Use instead project like [CocoaLumberjack](https://github.com/CocoaLumberjack/CocoaLumberjack)

# Usage
## Write to ouput stream
```swift
csl.println("write string and pass to the new line")
csl.print("write string without new line")
csl.println() // write new line
```
## Write to error stream
```swift
csl.errorln("write an error")
```
## Read from user input
```swift
if line = csl.readLine() {
  // do something
}
```
## Writing to a file
Create the file handle for writing (file must exist)
```swift
if let fileHandle = NSFileHandle(forWritingAtPath: "myoutput.file") { ..
```
Initialize the console object
```swift
var newCsl = csl.withOutput(fileHandle)
// or with more code
var newCsl = Phiole(input: input: Phiols.std.input, output: fileHandle, error: Phiols.std.error)
```
Write as usual
```swift
newCsl.println("write to a file")
```
Finally don't forget to close the file handle
```swift
fileHandle.closeFile()
```

## Add some colors in terminal or xcode
You can manually add color with decorated method
```
csl.println(Phiole.Color.green.fg("write in red"))
```
Or for all ouputs
```
csl.outputColor = .Green
csl.errorColor = .Red
... write here ...

// reset
csl.outputColor = .None
```

### For Xcode
**XcodeColors** is a simple plugin for Xcode, it allows you to use colors in the Xcode debugging console.

Full installation instructions can be found on the XcodeColors project page:  
https://github.com/robbiehanson/XcodeColors

Then you must add environment variable `XcodeColors` = `YES` in your Scheme

## More examples
In [main.swift](/Phiole/main.swift) or [Natalie (generate code from storyboard and ouput to standard stream or specified file)](https://github.com/phimage/Natalie/blob/console/natalie.swift)

# Setup #

## Copy/Paste ##
Just copy/paste code with licence in your script, or import swift file in your CLI project

## Using [cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/) ##

Add `pod 'Phiole', :git => 'https://github.com/phimage/Phiole.git'` to your `Podfile` and run `pod install`. 

Add `use_frameworks!` to the end of the `Podfile`.
